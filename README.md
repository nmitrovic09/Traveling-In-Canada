# HOW OFTEN CANADIANS HAVE BEEN TRAVELING

This project is an interactive visualization of the amount of passengers traveling across Canada. It combines four types of data such as the total, domestic, trans-border, and other data points. Each category was registered between 2013 and 2017. At the top of the data visualization, the large grid represents the amount of passengers in the whole country, and underneath there are eight active airports that range from East to West. In those grids, one square is represented by one million passengers which allows you to compare, contrast, and change between various airports such that you can identify the differences within a range of time. This visualization permits you to recognize how traveling has become more affordable and frequent in our time.

In the end, the interactive visualization shows how we have increased our movement over last few years which allows us to notice a growth of accessibility in transportation in the country.
